# Installation of Psi4

Download version at least [Psi4 1.2.1](https://github.com/psi4/psi4/releases/tag/v1.2.1) (git commit 406f4de)
or newer. Install according to the installation guides of Psi4 developers.
To set up Python interface set correctly the `PYTHONPATH` variable.
To check if it works,
simply go to interactive Python
and type
```python
import psi4
help(psi4)
```
If no import error is raised, then your Python-Psi4 interface is ready to use!
